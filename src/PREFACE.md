>In wine, the hand of God is foremost. But in brewing, it's the hand of man that is clearly visible, and that for me is one of its greatest fascinations.

-Randy Mosher

Preface
========

This is a book about beer. More specifically, this is a book about the beer experiences I've had over the past year. 
This book isn't a review of all the beers I've sampled; there are many more talented beer writers who have
tasted many more beers. This isn't a guidebook for where to drink beer. With the craft beer scene exploding any beer guidebook
seems like it would be outdated minutes after being published. This is a beer narrative. 

In my job I travel a lot and on my trips I've always gone out of my way to experience the beer culture where I've been. That
has resulted in some amazing experiences. One of the things I most love about beer is the story behind it. Every decision
made during the brewing process, from ingredients to timing, shaped that beer in a profound way. Every brewery has a specific 
philosophy and a specific character that sets them apart and makes them unique. This book is ultimately about those stories 
and how my personal beer journey overlapped with them.

I've always loved the writing of Craig Childs and Paul Theroux because they told very personal stories against the backdrop of
their environments. I come away from those books feeling like I have a deeper understanding of humanity but also of how the 
geography, economics, and culture all fit together as part of the grander story. Those same variables are what create the 
incredibly diverse spectrum of beers that we're able to enjoy. I want to tell the stories of my beer adventures while weaving 
in those strands and highlighting the story of the beers.

This book is about beer. It's about travel. It's about home. It's about family and friends. It's about strangers, nights of
excess, and repercussions in the morning. It's about the hops, malt, and the breweries who spin them into gold (or amber, 
or stout). This book is about life.

I hope you enjoy it and thank you for reading.
