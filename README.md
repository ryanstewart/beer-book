A Book About Beer
=================

Welcome! This is my repo for a book about beer that I'm writing. For the 
full story you can read the [preface](src/PREFACE.md). The tl;dr is that I'm 
a big beer drinker who travels a lot and this year had some amazing beer
experiences. So I decided to write them down.

Why GitHub?
-----------

I'm planning to self publish this book when/if it's done, but I also wanted to 
create it in a transparent way while making sure people could take it, build on it, 
modify it, and grow it further. I'm licensing it under a [Creative Commons Attribution license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/deed.en_US) 
so that's possible, but I also want people to feel free to help out with the 
core project. 

Many, many of the people I talk to in tech are into beer. For the book 
I wanted to be able to incorporate interesting facts and background about the
beers and breweries I talk about. My hope is that by using GitHub some of those
beer-savvy tech people who are interested in the book can help fact check, add 
background, or correct typos. When you see an error, or have a suggestion where a 
specific fact would help flesh out the book, I would apprecaite any pull requests.

Who are you?
------------

I'm [Ryan](http://blog.digitalbackcountry.com). I live in Seattle, drink a lot of beer, 
travel a fair amount, and work for Adobe as a product manager on [Edge Code](http://html.adobe.com/edge/code). You can 
always [find me on Untappd](https://untappd.com/user/ryanstewart).
